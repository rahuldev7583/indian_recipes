    <ol>
      <h3>Aloo Filling</h3>
      <li>Once your potatoes have been steamed allow them to cool slightly. Grate the potatoes, then allow them to cool completely.</li>
      <li>To the cooled and grated potatoes add in salt, chopped coriander, chopped chillies, ground clove, ground cinnamon, desiccated coconut and lemon juice.</li>
      <li>Divide into equal 8 balls.</li>
    <h3>Paratha Dough</h3>
      <li>Add medium atta to a bowl, and mix in salt and oil.</li>
      <li>Pour in water and mix. Add more water if needed, you want a semi-soft dough.</li>
      <li>Knead the dough for around 5 minutes. Drizzle around 1tsp of oil, knead 2 times more, then form into a ball and cover for 15-20 minutes. Then, divide into 8 equal balls.</li>
      <h3>Assembly</h3>
      <li>Heat your tawa or pan over low heat.</li>
      <li>Grab a Paratha dough ball and gently press between your hands to create a small disc, dip into some flour, making sure both sides are coated and dust of excess flour.</li>
      <li>Then roll into a 5 1/2 inch circle. Add the aloo filling in the middle. Bring edges together, and pinch at the top. Gently flatten the stuffed Paratha with your hands.</li>
      <li>Dip both sides into some flour. Place seam side down and roll into a 6 1/2 inch circle.</li>
      <li>Place Paratha onto the heated pan, seam side up and cook for 30-40 seconds or until you see a couple of small light brown spots.</li>
    <li>Increase the temperature to medium, then flip and cook the other side for 2 minutes or until you see brown spots. Drizzle around 1 tsp oil to the top, then flip again.</li>
    <li>Drizzle a little oil over the other side, and allow to cook for around 40 seconds or until golden. Be sure to press the edges gently to ensure the parathas cook.</li>
    <li>Flip for a final time and cook until golden.</li>
    <li>Repeat the above steps until you get 8 beautiful stuffed Aloo Parathas. (this includes bring the temperature back to low!)</li>
    <h3>Tomato Chutney</h3>
    <li>Place tomatoes into a pot with water. Boil until the skin start to peel off.</li>
    <li>Rinse tomatoes under cold water. Peel off the skin, and scrape off any tomato pulp that's stuck on the skin.</li>
    <li>Place tomatoes into a food processor or with an immersion blender, pulse the tomatoes with all the spices until smooth-ish. Pour back into a saucepan and cook for around 1-3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Garnish with freshly chopped coriander and enjoy!</li>
